## Description

A mod that adds more character types to choose from!

Previously, these characters could only be found in Stick Fight's
unimplemented AI. With the the use of a new menu, users can now select and
play as 3 different choices (The Bolt, The Player, and The Zombie).

Whenever you're in the main menu, select your desired character choice. 
To re-select, simply exit back to the main menu. **This is <ins>not</ins> 
client-side, the character type that you choose will be the one everyone
else plays with, and vice-versa**.

### Advantages and Disadvantages:

| The Bolt       | • Quick and nimble.                                                                                         | • Unable to pick up most weapons nor use melee weapons. |
| The Player     | • Your average reliable Joe, well-rounded in all fields.<br> • Able to use all weapons where others cannot. | • Nothing special about it.                             |
